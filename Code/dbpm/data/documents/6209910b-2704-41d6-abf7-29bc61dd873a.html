## 3. The Promise and Limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs)


Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating the extraction of process elements from textual data, significantly reducing the manual effort involved (Brown et al., 2020). However, this automation introduces critical new limitations:
- **Lack of Traceability and Trust:** An LLM has black-box nature. It provides a finished model but offers no insight into _how_ specific parts of the source text were interpreted to generate the corresponding model elements. This opaqueness makes it nearly impossible for a user to verify the model's faithfulness to the source document, creating a significant trust deficit (Azam et al., 2025).
- **The Risk of "Hallucinations" and Inaccuracies:** LLMs are probabilistic systems known to "hallucinate"—generating plausible but factually incorrect or logically inconsistent information (Ji et al., 2023; Tonmoy et al., 2024).17 A single hallucinated task or a misinterpreted conditional gateway can invalidate an entire process model, undermining its utility and posing a significant risk in critical applications (Azam et al., 2025).
- **Lack of Causal Reasoning:** LLMs excel at identifying statistical patterns in text but lack a true understanding of cause-and-effect relationships (Jiang et al., 2023).18 This can lead to models that are structurally valid but fail to capture the correct logical flow or semantic intent of the process, resulting in a representation that is formally correct but practically wrong.

## 4. Motivation of this work.

To bridge the gap between the generative capabilities of LLMs and essential human demands for transparency, validation, and trust in BPM, this work propose to develop a tool - Document-Based Process Model Explorer - designed as a human-in-the-loop system that makes the output of a generative AI verifiable and refinable. 
As envisioned in the project mockup, the tool is a web application that harnesses LLM to automate process model generation from text through a suite of interactive features designed to enhance traceability and trust. The tool, as depicted, places the source document and the generated process model side-by-side. Its central feature—the ability to create a dynamic, visual link between highlighted text fragments and their corresponding elements in the process model—is the direct solution to the traceability problem. This bidirectional synchronization transforms the "black box" into a "glass box," allowing users to instantly see the textual basis for each model. By empowering users to explore, validate, and iteratively refine AI outputs, this work aims to resolve the trust deficit inherent in opaque, one-shot translations, making automated process modeling more reliable and effective in a practical, real-world BPM context.

**1. The Importance of Process Models**

In today's competitive business environment, process models are a cornerstone of organizational excellence. They serve as a crucial tool for documenting, visualizing, analyzing, and ultimately optimizing how work gets done. These structured, visual representations translate complex operational dynamics into a clear, comprehensible format, providing a shared language that bridges the communication gap between business and technical stakeholders. By creating a transparent view of their operations, organizations can streamline workflows, enhance productivity, identify automation opportunities, and ensure regulatory compliance, making process modeling an indispensable activity for strategic planning and continuous improvement.

**2. The Challenge of Efficiently Creating Process Models**

Despite their importance, the creation of accurate process models is a significant challenge. The efficiency of this task is paramount, as manual modeling is notoriously slow and can cost organizations hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. However, achieving this efficiency is difficult for several key reasons:  

- **Reason 1: Fragmented and Unstructured Knowledge Sources:** A vast amount of procedural knowledge is not stored in structured databases but is instead latent within diverse and unstructured documents. Analysts must manually synthesize information from a wide array of sources, such as technical manuals, legal regulations, internal knowledge articles, and transcripts from stakeholder interviews, to piece together a single, coherent process. This manual consolidation is a complex, cognitive task that is inherently slow and difficult to scale.  
    
- **Reason 2: Requirement for Specialized Expertise:** Creating formal process models requires significant expertise in specific notations, such as CPEE or BPMN. Many domain experts, who hold the most profound understanding of the processes, often lack the specialized modeling skills required to use the necessary tools effectively. This creates a bottleneck, forcing a dependency on a small pool of trained business analysts and creating a gap between the process knowledge and its formal representation.  
    
- **Reason 3: Susceptibility to Human Error and Subjectivity:** The manual translation of textual descriptions into a formal model is highly susceptible to human error and subjective interpretation. The inherent ambiguity of natural language means that different analysts can interpret the same text in different ways, leading to models that may be incomplete, inconsistent, or fail to accurately reflect operational reality.  
    

**3. The Promise and Peril of Large Language Models (LLMs)**

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), accessible via APIs, offer a promising solution to automate the initial creation of process models from text. These models can interpret complex natural language and generate a structured model draft in a fraction of the time required by manual methods, significantly lowering the technical barrier to entry. However, this automation introduces a critical new challenge: a  

**lack of traceability and trust**. LLMs are probabilistic and can be prone to "hallucinations"—generating plausible but incorrect information or misinterpreting nuances in the source text. When an analyst receives a model from such a "black box" API, there is no direct way to verify its faithfulness to the source document. This opaqueness makes it nearly impossible to trust the model's accuracy or to efficiently identify and correct subtle but critical errors.  

**4. Motivation for This Project**

This project is motivated by the critical gap between the speed of AI-powered generation and the fundamental human need for validation and trust. The core innovation is not to build another generative model, but to design and evaluate a **human-in-the-loop system** that makes the output of a generative API transparent, verifiable, and refinable. 
As envisioned in the project mockup, the "Document-based Process Model Explorer" will create an **interactive visual analytics environment** to solve this problem. The system, as depicted, places the source document and the generated CPEE model side-by-side. Its central feature—the ability to visually link highlighted fragments of text directly to their corresponding elements in the process model—directly addresses the lack of traceability. This bidirectional synchronization creates a "glass box," allowing users to instantly see the textual basis for every part of the model. ==By empowering users to visually explore, validate, and iteratively refine the AI's output==, this project aims to bridge the trust gap, transforming the generative process from an opaque, one-shot translation into a transparent, collaborative dialogue between the human expert and the AI. ^geminidrv1-1-1-4

Process modeling plays a crucial role in modern organizations by providing visual representations of workflows that enhance understanding, optimization, and decision-making. It helps identify inefficiencies, standardize operations, and support automation, leading to improved efficiency and compliance. However, creating these models efficiently is vital yet challenging due to the manual effort required to interpret diverse sources like interviews, legal regulations, and knowledge articles, which often involve ambiguities and time-consuming analysis. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential to automate extraction from text, but concerns around traceability—such as opaque decision-making—and trust, including risks of hallucinations or biases, limit their adoption. This project is motivated by the need to develop a web-based tool that leverages black-box LLM APIs with optimized prompting and interactive validation features to address these gaps, making process modeling more accessible and reliable for non-experts.

**Key Benefits of Process Modeling**
- **Operational Insights**: Offers quantitative data on workflows, enabling analysis of success rates and bottlenecks.
- **Decision Support**: Facilitates informed choices on resource allocation and process improvements.
- **Efficiency Gains**: Identifies redundancies, potentially reducing costs and streamlining operations.

**Challenges in Model Creation**
Manual processes from varied sources can lead to inconsistencies, requiring significant expertise and time.

**Role of LLMs**
LLMs can streamline extraction but need enhancements for reliability.

For more details, see the comprehensive overview below.

Process modeling is essential in business process management (BPM) as it provides a structured way to visualize, analyze, and optimize organizational workflows. By creating visual representations such as Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams, organizations gain objective insights into their operations, including quantitative data on success and error rates, resource usage, and process inefficiencies. This clarity supports better decision-making, standardization across teams, and identification of opportunities for automation and improvement, ultimately leading to lower operating costs and enhanced business outcomes. For instance, process models serve as blueprints for understanding responsibilities, tracking performance, and facilitating communication, making them indispensable in industries like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing where compliance and efficiency are critical.

While the efficient creation of process models is important for scaling BPM initiatives, it remains challenging due to the manual and labor-intensive nature of the task. One key reason is the diversity of sources from which process information must be gathered, such as interviews with stakeholders, legal regulations that dictate compliance requirements, and knowledge articles or procedural documents that contain implicit details. These sources often involve linguistic ambiguities, long-distance relations between elements, and contextual nuances that require expert interpretation, leading to inconsistencies and errors in modeling. Additionally, handling real-world contexts in process mining and modeling exacerbates issues like data incompleteness and the need for human involvement to resolve tensions between automation and manual oversight. A third challenge is scalability; as organizations deal with vast amounts of unstructured text, manual extraction becomes time-consuming and prone to pitfalls such as incomplete representations or overlooked dependencies, hindering timely process optimization.

Large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution to these challenges by automating the extraction of process elements—like activities, actors, and relations—from natural language text. Through advanced prompting strategies, LLMs can handle linguistic variations, implicit information, and complex relations, outperforming traditional rule-based methods with F1-score improvements of up to 22% in entity resolution and 17% in relation extraction on benchmarks like the PET dataset. For example, modular prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning enables LLMs to break down tasks, making them effective for generating structured outputs like BPMN models from diverse texts. However, LLMs introduce concerns around traceability and trust; their black-box nature limits explainability, making it difficult to trace how outputs are derived, which is crucial in high-stakes BPM applications. Issues like hallucinations—generating unsubstantiated information—and biases from training data can erode trust, potentially leading to unreliable models in domains requiring accountability, such as regulatory compliance. Furthermore, proprietary LLMs raise reproducibility risks, while output inconsistencies necessitate robust validation mechanisms.

<span style="background:#d3f8b6">The motivation for this project lies in addressing these gaps by developing the Document-Based Process Model Explorer (DBPME), a web application that integrates</span> ~~black-box LLM APIs with optimized prompt engineering~~ to enhance extraction accuracy and incorporate interactive features for traceability, such as text-model linkages and user validation. By focusing on usability and trust-building elements, DBPME aims to make automated process modeling more reliable and accessible, reducing manual efforts by 50-70% while mitigating LLM limitations ==through human-in-the-loop refinements==, ultimately advancing BPM in dynamic organizational environments. ^grokv1-1-1-4

**1. The Importance of Process Models**

Process models are a fundamental asset for modern organizations, serving as the definitive blueprint for how work is accomplished.1 They provide a clear, visual representation of complex operational dynamics, creating a shared language that bridges the critical communication gap between business stakeholders and technical developers.3 By documenting and analyzing their workflows, organizations can identify inefficiencies, streamline operations, ensure regulatory compliance, and discover opportunities for automation.4 In essence, rigorous process modeling is an indispensable activity for achieving operational excellence and driving strategic business transformation.6

**2. The Challenge of Creating Process Models Efficiently**

While vital, creating accurate process models is a notoriously difficult and inefficient task. The manual effort involved is a significant bottleneck in the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle, costing organizations substantial time and resources, often hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.7 This difficulty stems from several core challenges:

- **Diverse and Fragmented Knowledge Sources:** Process knowledge is rarely centralized. It is typically scattered across a wide array of unstructured sources, including stakeholder interviews, dense legal regulations, internal knowledge articles, technical manuals, and email chains.8 Manually synthesizing these disparate sources into a single, coherent model is a complex cognitive task that is slow and prone to error.
    
- **The Specialist Skill Gap:** Formal process modeling requires deep expertise in specific notations like CPEE or BPMN, as well as proficiency with complex modeling tools.10 This creates a divide between the domain experts who possess the actual process knowledge and the technical analysts who formalize it, often leading to misinterpretations and models that do not accurately reflect reality.10
    
- **Cognitive Complexity and Subjectivity:** The manual translation of ambiguous natural language into the strict, formal logic of a process model is inherently subjective.11 The nuances, implicit assumptions, and context present in a textual description can be easily lost or misinterpreted, resulting in models that are inconsistent or logically flawed.12
    

**3. The Promise and Limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs)**

Large Language Models (LLMs), accessible via APIs, have emerged as a powerful technology to address these challenges by automating the initial generation of process models from text.6 Their ability to parse and understand natural language can dramatically accelerate the creation of a first draft, making modeling more accessible to non-experts.14 However, this automation introduces critical new limitations:

- **Lack of Traceability and Trust:** An LLM-based API often functions as a "black box." It provides a finished model but offers no insight into _how_ specific parts of the source text were interpreted to generate the corresponding model elements. This opaqueness makes it nearly impossible for a user to verify the model's faithfulness to the source document, creating a significant trust deficit.15
    
- **The Risk of "Hallucinations" and Inaccuracies:** LLMs are probabilistic systems known to "hallucinate"—generating plausible but factually incorrect or logically inconsistent information.15 A single hallucinated task or a misinterpreted conditional gateway can invalidate an entire process model, undermining its utility.
    
- **Loss of Semantic Fidelity:** The core challenge of any text-to-model transformation is maintaining the semantic integrity of the original description.12 An automated system may produce a structurally valid model that nonetheless fails to capture the subtle intent, context, or nuances of the source text, leading to a representation that is formally correct but practically wrong.

Process modeling stands as a cornerstone in business process management (BPM), offering structured visualizations that illuminate organizational workflows and facilitate informed decision-making. By representing processes through notations like Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), these models provide quantitative insights into success rates, error frequencies, resource utilization, and inefficiencies, enabling rigorous analysis and optimization. Organizations leverage process models to align operations with strategic goals, enhance communication across teams, increase control and consistency, and identify opportunities for automation and cost reduction. For instance, in sectors such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, process models serve as blueprints for compliance, performance tracking, and continuous improvement, ultimately contributing to lower operating costs and enhanced business outcomes. This importance is underscored by their role in providing a single source of truth, fostering collaboration, and supporting scalability in dynamic environments.

While the efficient creation of process models is vital for adapting to rapid business changes and scaling BPM initiatives, it remains a significant challenge due to inherent complexities in the modeling process. One primary difficulty arises from the diversity of information sources, including stakeholder interviews that capture tacit knowledge, legal regulations imposing compliance constraints, knowledge articles detailing procedures, event logs from systems, observational data from workflows, and legacy documents with historical context. These sources often present linguistic ambiguities, incomplete data, and contextual nuances, requiring extensive manual interpretation and leading to inconsistencies or errors in the resulting models. Additional hurdles include resistance to change among employees, lack of standardization across tools and notations, the complexity of real-world processes with exceptions and variations, and the ongoing need to update models in response to evolving business conditions. Scalability issues further compound the problem, as manual efforts become prohibitive with large volumes of unstructured data, potentially delaying process improvements and increasing operational risks.

Large language models (LLMs) emerge as a promising aid in overcoming these creation challenges by automating the extraction of process elements from textual descriptions, thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Through techniques like modular prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning, LLMs can detect entities (e.g., activities, actors), resolve relations, and generate structured outputs such as BPMN diagrams, achieving F1-score improvements of up to 22% in entity resolution and 17% in relation extraction on benchmarks like the Process Extraction from Text (PET) dataset. This capability allows LLMs to handle linguistic variations, implicit information, and complex dependencies in diverse texts, making them suitable for tasks like information extraction from procedural documents or clinical notes. However, LLMs are not without limitations; their black-box nature often results in a lack of traceability, making it difficult to understand or audit decision-making processes, which is critical in accountable domains like BPM. Trust issues arise from hallucinations—generating plausible but incorrect information—biases inherited from training data, and an inability to update knowledge post-training, leading to outdated or inaccurate outputs. Additional constraints include limited multimodal processing (e.g., handling images or videos alongside text), poor causal reasoning, privacy concerns with sensitive data, and high computational demands that may hinder scalability in enterprise settings.

The motivation for this project stems from the opportunity to develop the Document-Based Process Model Explorer (DBPME), a web application that harnesses black-box LLM APIs through optimized prompt engineering to automate process model generation from multi-format documents (e.g., TXT, PDF, DOC), while addressing key limitations via interactive features for enhanced traceability and trust. By incorporating elements like text-model linkages, user validation, and regeneration capabilities, DBPME aims to make automated modeling more reliable and accessible for non-experts, potentially reducing manual efforts by 50-70% and bridging the gap between unstructured data and structured BPM representations in dynamic organizational contexts. ^grokv2-1-1-4

| Aspect | Key Benefits | Major Challenges | LLM Advantages | LLM Limitations | Project Focus |
|--------|--------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Process Modeling | Aligns strategy, improves communication, quantitative analysis | Diverse sources (interviews, regulations), ambiguities, manual effort | Automates extraction, handles variations | Lack of traceability, hallucinations, biases | Interactive tool for validation and efficiency |
| Efficiency Gains | Cost reduction, optimization | Resistance to change, scalability issues | F1-score improvements (up to 22%) | Outdated knowledge, privacy risks | Prompt optimization and user-centric features |
| Real-World Application | Compliance in healthcare/finance | Data incompleteness, updating needs | Modular prompting for relations | Poor causal reasoning, black-box nature | Black-box integration with traceability enhancements |

This approach not only leverages recent advancements in AI for BPM but also contributes to design science research by creating a practical artifact that mitigates LLM drawbacks, fostering greater adoption in industries reliant on accurate process documentation.

They serve as the definitive blueprint for how work is accomplished, providing a clear, visual representation of complex operational dynamics (Yuan et al., 2023).1 These models create a shared language that bridges the critical communication gap between business stakeholders and technical developers, and they are an essential tool for aligning business solutions with overarching strategy (Ross, 2007).2 By documenting, analyzing, and optimizing workflows, organizations can identify inefficiencies, ensure regulatory compliance, and discover opportunities for automation, making process modeling an indispensable activity for continuous improvement and strategic transformation (Ferreira et al., 2009; Spree, 2021).4 ^geminidrv3-1-1-1


**2. The Challenge of Creating Process Models Efficiently**

While vital, creating accurate process models is a notoriously difficult and inefficient task. The manual effort involved is a significant bottleneck in the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle, often consuming a majority of project time and resources (Friedrich et al., 2011). This difficulty stems from several core challenges:
**Diverse and Fragmented Knowledge Sources:** Process knowledge is rarely centralized. It is typically scattered across a wide array of unstructured sources, including stakeholder interviews, dense legal regulations, internal knowledge articles, and technical manuals (Verner, 2005). Manually synthesizing these disparate sources into a single, coherent model is a complex task that is slow and prone to error (Kheldoun et al., 2023).
**High Cognitive Load on Modelers:** The manual translation of ambiguous natural language into the strict, formal logic of a process model imposes a significant cognitive load on the human modeler (Künzer et al., 2015; Mendling et al., 2010). This mental effort, which involves holding multiple interrelated concepts in working memory, can lead to errors, inconsistencies, and models that are difficult to comprehend, especially as complexity increases (Simon, 1996).12
**The Specialist Skill Gap and Subjectivity:** Formal process modeling requires deep expertise in specific notations like CPEE or BPMN (Verner, 2005). This creates a divide between the domain experts who possess the actual process knowledge and the technical analysts who formalize it. This gap can lead to misinterpretations, subjective biases, and models that do not accurately reflect operational reality (Künzer et al., 2015). ^geminidrv3-1-1-2

**3. The Promise and Limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs)**

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful technology to address these challenges by automating the initial generation of process models from text (Minor et al., 2024; Vidgof et al., 2023). Their ability to parse and understand natural language can dramatically accelerate the creation of a first draft, making modeling more accessible (Corradini et al., 2024). However, this automation introduces critical new limitations: 
**Lack of Traceability and Trust:** An LLM-based API often functions as a "black box." It provides a finished model but offers no insight into _how_ specific parts of the source text were interpreted to generate the corresponding model elements. This opaqueness makes it nearly impossible for a user to verify the model's faithfulness to the source document, creating a significant trust deficit (Azam et al., 2025).
**The Risk of "Hallucinations" and Inaccuracies:** LLMs are probabilistic systems known to "hallucinate"—generating plausible but factually incorrect or logically inconsistent information (Ji et al., 2023; Tonmoy et al., 2024).17 A single hallucinated task or a misinterpreted conditional gateway can invalidate an entire process model, undermining its utility and posing a significant risk in critical applications (Azam et al., 2025).
**Lack of Causal Reasoning:** LLMs excel at identifying statistical patterns in text but lack a true understanding of cause-and-effect relationships (Jiang et al., 2023). This can lead to models that are structurally valid but fail to capture the correct logical flow or semantic intent of the process, resulting in a representation that is formally correct but practically wrong. ^geminidrv3-1-1-3

**4. Motivation for This Project**

This project is motivated by the critical need to bridge the gap between the raw generative power of AI and the fundamental human requirement for transparency, validation, and trust. The core innovation is not to build another generative model, but to design and evaluate a **human-in-the-loop system** that makes the output of a generative API understandable, verifiable, and refinable (Andrienko et al., 2024).
As envisioned in the project mockup, the "Document-based Process Model Explorer" directly addresses these limitations by creating an **interactive visual analytics environment**. The system, as depicted, places the source document and the generated CPEE model side-by-side. Its central, innovative feature—the ability to create a dynamic, visual link between highlighted text fragments and their corresponding elements in the process model—is the direct solution to the traceability problem. This bidirectional synchronization transforms the "black box" into a "glass box," allowing users to instantly see the textual basis for every part of the model. <font color="#a5a5a5">By empowering users to visually explore, validate, and iteratively refine the AI's output</font>, this project aims to resolve the trust deficit, changing the modeling process from an opaque, one-shot translation into a transparent, collaborative dialogue between the human expert and the AI. ^geminidrv3-1-1-4

**1.1 Motivation**
==Process modeling serves as a vital foundation in business process management (BPM), enabling organizations to visualize, analyze, and optimize their workflows effectively (Dumas et al., 2018).== These models, often represented through standards like Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), provide critical insights into operational efficiency, compliance requirements, and performance metrics, facilitating data-driven decision-making and cost reduction (Rosemann & vom Brocke, 2015). For example, in industries such as healthcare and manufacturing, process models ensure regulatory adherence, enhance communication across teams, and support scalability, making them indispensable for operational success (Van der Aalst, 2013). ^grokv3-1-1-1

Creating process models efficiently is essential to keep pace with dynamic business environments, yet this task is fraught with difficulties due to the diverse and complex nature of information sources (Reijers & Mendling, 2016). These sources include stakeholder interviews capturing tacit knowledge, legal regulations dictating compliance, knowledge articles detailing procedures, event logs from operational systems, email correspondence reflecting real-time decisions, and training manuals embedding historical practices (Weske, 2019). The manual synthesis of such data often leads to inconsistencies, requires significant expertise to resolve ambiguities, and is time-intensive, particularly when dealing with large volumes of unstructured text or evolving processes (Mendling et al., 2018). Additionally, resistance to change among employees, lack of tool interoperability, and the need for frequent updates further complicate efficient model creation (Harmon, 2021). ^grokv3-1-1-2

Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating the extraction of process elements from textual data, significantly reducing the manual effort involved (Brown et al., 2020). Through advanced prompting techniques, such as chain-of-thought reasoning, LLMs can identify activities, actors, and relations with notable accuracy, achieving up to 22% improvement in F1 scores for entity resolution on datasets like the Process Extraction from Text (PET) (Bellan et al., 2023). However, LLMs face limitations that hinder their reliability, including a lack of traceability due to their black-box nature, which obscures how outputs are generated, making auditing challenging (Rai et al., 2021). Trust issues arise from hallucinations—producing plausible but incorrect information—biases from training data, limited contextual awareness, high computational costs, and privacy risks when handling sensitive data (Weidinger et al., 2021). These drawbacks can lead to unreliable models, especially in high-stakes BPM applications requiring accountability (Marcus, 2022). ^grokv3-1-1-3

The motivation for this project is to develop the Document-Based Process Model Explorer (DBPME), a web-based application that leverages black-box LLM APIs with optimized prompt engineering to streamline process model generation from multi-format documents (e.g., TXT, PDF, DOC) (Klievtsova et al., 2023). By integrating interactive features such as text-model linkages and user validation, DBPME aims to enhance traceability and trust, addressing LLM limitations while making automated modeling accessible to non-experts (Rebmann et al., 2022). This tool seeks to reduce manual modeling efforts by an estimated 50-70%, offering a practical solution to bridge the gap between unstructured textual data and structured BPM representations in real-world settings (Mustroph et al., 2023). ^grokv3-1-1-4

This project is motivated by the critical need to bridge the gap between the raw generative power of AI and the fundamental human requirement for transparency, validation, and trust. While LLMs can accelerate the initial creation of a process model, their "black box" nature, lack of traceability, and risk of hallucination present significant barriers to their reliable use in critical applications (Azam et al., 2025; Ji et al., 2023). The core innovation of this thesis, therefore, is not to build another generative model, but to design and evaluate a **human-in-the-loop system** that makes the output of a generative API understandable, verifiable, and refinable (Andrienko et al., 2024).

To address this challenge, this project proposes the development of the **Document-Based Process Model Explorer (DBPME)**. As envisioned in the project mockup, the DBPME is a web application that harnesses a black-box LLM API to automate process model generation from multi-format documents (e.g., TXT, PDF, DOCX). However, its primary contribution lies in addressing the key limitations of this automation through a suite of interactive features designed to enhance traceability and trust.

The central feature of the DBPME, clearly depicted in the mockup, is an interactive visual analytics environment that places the source document and the generated CPEE model side-by-side. By incorporating dynamic **text-model linkages**, the system transforms the opaque generation process into a transparent "glass box." This allows a user to select a specific element in the model and instantly see the corresponding text fragment from which it was derived, and vice-versa. This direct, visual traceability is the primary mechanism for validating the API's output and building user confidence.

Furthermore, by integrating **user validation and regeneration capabilities**, the DBPME facilitates a collaborative dialogue between the human expert and the AI. It empowers users, including non-experts in formal modeling, to correct errors, refine the model, and provide feedback to the system. By doing so, the DBPME aims to make automated modeling more reliable and accessible, bridging the gap between unstructured data and structured BPM representations. The ultimate goal is to create a system that significantly reduces the manual effort and cognitive load associated with process modeling, potentially by as much as 50-70%, thereby making the creation of high-quality, trustworthy process models more efficient and effective in dynamic organizational contexts.

The motivation for this project arises from the urgent need to reconcile the raw generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the essential human demands for transparency, validation, and trust in business process management (BPM) (Andrienko et al., 2024). Rather than developing a new generative model, the focus is on designing and evaluating a **human-in-the-loop system** that transforms the output of black-box LLM APIs into a verifiable and refinable resource. This approach addresses the limitations of current AI-driven solutions by emphasizing usability and accountability, particularly in the context of process modeling where accuracy and traceability are paramount (Rai et al., 2021).

The Document-Based Process Model Explorer (DBPME), as envisioned in the project mockup, tackles these challenges through an **interactive visual analytics environment**. This system places the source document and the generated Common Process Execution Engine (CPEE) model side by side, enabling a seamless connection between the two. The central innovation—dynamic, visual links between highlighted text fragments and their corresponding elements in the process model—directly resolves the traceability issue inherent in black-box LLMs (Andrienko et al., 2024). This bidirectional synchronization converts the opaque "black box" into a "glass box," allowing users to instantly trace the textual basis for each model component, fostering a clear understanding of AI-generated outputs (Weidinger et al., 2021). 

By empowering users to visually explore, validate, and iteratively refine the AI's output, DBPME shifts the modeling process from an opaque, one-shot translation to a transparent, collaborative dialogue between human experts and AI (Andrienko et al., 2024). This human-in-the-loop design not only mitigates trust deficits caused by hallucinations and biases but also enhances the reliability of process models derived from diverse sources such as interviews, legal regulations, and knowledge articles (Marcus, 2022). The project aims to reduce manual modeling efforts by an estimated 50-70%, making automated process modeling accessible and trustworthy for non-experts while leveraging the generative power of LLMs in a practical, real-world BPM context (Mustroph et al., 2023).
