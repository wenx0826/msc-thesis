Research questions are essential for guiding investigations into improving business process modeling, particularly through AI-assisted tools with enhanced traceability. The following three questions focus on related work, usability and user experience, and evaluation and impact, each stated as a single sentence followed by a detailed explanation that incorporates how the proposed document-based process model explorer will be validated for effectiveness.

RQ1: What is the current state of related work in business process modeling tools?
Current business process modeling tools, such as those leveraging BPMN and ontology-based approaches, provide foundational support for documenting and optimizing workflows but often struggle with integrating fragmented knowledge sources and ensuring traceability in AI-generated models (Ferreira et al., 2009; Friedrich et al., 2011). These tools, exemplified by ARIS and BonitaBPM, emphasize visual representations and automation opportunities, yet limitations include high manual effort, cognitive overload from formal notations, and insufficient handling of LLM-induced issues like hallucinations and lack of causal reasoning (Ross, 2006; Vidgof et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). To prove the proposed explorer's superiority, a literature review will be complemented by comparative benchmarking against 5-10 existing tools using datasets from regulatory and operational contexts, measuring improvements in traceability (e.g., via conformance scores) and trust (e.g., user confidence surveys) to demonstrate quantifiable reductions in modeling errors and time.

RQ2: What interaction paradigms increase user efficiency and accuracy when working with document-driven process modeling tools?
Interaction paradigms such as bidirectional text-model linking and visual analytics in human-in-the-loop systems can enhance efficiency by minimizing cognitive load and enabling real-time validation, as seen in frameworks that integrate natural language processing with formal modeling notations (Künzer et al., 2015; Mendling et al., 2010; Andrienko et al., 2024). Furthermore, different user groups like business analysts and engineers utilize these explorers differently—analysts focus on high-level compliance checks via intuitive interfaces, while engineers emphasize detailed logical mappings—compared to traditional tools where notation expertise creates barriers and subjective biases (Verner et al., 2005; Kheldoun et al., 2023). To validate the solution's effectiveness, usability studies with 20-30 participants from varied roles will employ metrics like task completion time, error rates, and System Usability Scale scores, comparing the explorer to tools like BPMN Sketch Miner through controlled experiments and statistical analyses (e.g., ANOVA) to confirm significant gains in efficiency, accuracy, and user satisfaction across groups.

RQ3: What metrics can be used to measure the effectiveness of a document-based process model explorer versus conventional modeling tools?
Metrics such as structural complexity (e.g., number of gateways and connectivity ratios), usability attributes (e.g., learnability and error rates), and performance indicators (e.g., compliance adherence and cycle time) can assess effectiveness, drawing from established frameworks for BPMN evaluation (Spree, 2021; Minor et al., 2024). The use of such tools impacts compliance by facilitating traceable audits, change management through iterative refinements, and process optimization by identifying inefficiencies in real-world scenarios, though challenges like hallucinations in LLMs require mitigation (Ji et al., 2023; Tonmoy et al., 2024; Azam et al., 2025; Corradini et al., 2024). To prove the explorer's benefits, longitudinal case studies in sectors like finance will track pre- and post-implementation metrics over 6-12 months, using mixed-methods approaches including regression analysis and qualitative interviews to establish causal improvements in compliance rates, change cycles, and optimization outcomes compared to conventional tools.

**RQ1: What are the principal challenges and opportunities for innovation in the domain of document-based business process modeling in the era of Generative AI?**

**Explanation:** This foundational question aims to situate the project within the current academic and technological landscape. The answer will be developed by first surveying the state-of-the-art in business process modeling tools, from traditional manual editors to emerging automated solutions. It will then critically examine the performance of Generative AI in this context, focusing on its potential to accelerate model creation from text while also acknowledging its significant limitations, such as the risk of factual inaccuracies or "hallucinations" and a fundamental lack of traceability and user trust (Ji et al., 2023; Vidgof et al., 2023),. Finally, this question will explore the novelty of document-centric interaction paradigms. By analyzing tools that place documents at the center of the user experience (e.g., Google's NotebookLM) and contrasting them with existing text-to-model approaches, this research will identify the specific gap and opportunity for a tool like the one envisioned in the mockup—an interactive explorer that visually bridges unstructured text and structured models to create a verifiable and trustworthy workflow.

**RQ2: How can a document-based process modeling tool be designed to ensure high usability, effective functionality, and a positive user experience in a human-in-the-loop workflow?**

**Explanation:** This question focuses on the core design of the artifact itself. It investigates the principles for creating a system that not only automates a task but also empowers the user. The answer will be the specific design of the Document-Based Process Model Explorer, as depicted in the mockup. The explanation will detail how the tool's architecture and features are purpose-built to achieve a good user experience. This includes analyzing how the side-by-side presentation of the document and the model, combined with the core feature of **bidirectional visual linking**, can foster transparency and trust. Furthermore, it will explore how this interaction paradigm can reduce the cognitive load on users during complex validation tasks (Mendling et al., 2010). The design for optimal functionality will also be addressed by detailing the iterative workflow, which includes features for error correction, direct model editing, and regeneration, thereby creating an effective and efficient human-AI partnership.

RQ3: To what extent does the Document-Based Process Model Explorer enhance the modeling performance, output quality, and professional confidence of requirements engineers and process designers when compared to traditional modeling workflows?

Of course. I have carefully analyzed your three research questions, which are an excellent synthesis of our previous discussions. I have refined them slightly for clarity and impact, and then developed the detailed explanations for each.

My explanations are grounded in a thorough analysis of all the images from our conversation, especially the detailed mockup you provided in the first turn. This mockup serves as the visual anchor for the entire project, and the research questions are now explicitly tied to the features and workflow it depicts.

### **1.2 Research Questions**

This thesis is guided by three primary research questions that address the context, design, and impact of the proposed Document-Based Process Model Explorer.

**RQ1: What are the key approaches, tools, and principal challenges in the domain of document-based business process modeling, and what opportunities for innovation does the era of Generative AI present?**

**Explanation:** This foundational question aims to situate the project within the current academic and technological landscape. The answer will be developed by first surveying the state-of-the-art in business process modeling, from traditional manual tools to automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing (NLP). The survey will then focus on the paradigm shift introduced by Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), which can automate the generation of process models directly from text.

However, the core of this investigation will be a critical analysis of the **principal challenges** that this new paradigm introduces. These challenges include the inherent limitations of LLMs, such as their propensity for "hallucinations" (generating factually incorrect or unfaithful content), a fundamental lack of traceability between the source text and the generated output, and a tendency to exhibit overconfidence in their incorrect predictions. The analysis will also consider related document-centric AI tools (e.g., Google's NotebookLM) to understand different interaction paradigms.

By identifying these challenges, the research defines the **opportunity for innovation**: to create a system that moves beyond simple generation to address the critical needs of trust and verifiability. This thesis argues that the opportunity lies not in building a better generative model, but in designing a novel _human-in-the-loop_ system that makes the output of any generative model transparent and trustworthy. This directly leads to the solution envisioned in the mockup from our first conversation: an interactive explorer that visually bridges the gap between unstructured documents and structured process models.

**RQ2: How can a document-based process modeling tool be designed to ensure high usability, effective functionality, and a positive user experience in a human-in-the-loop workflow?**

**Explanation:** This question focuses on the core design of the artifact itself—the "how" of the solution. It investigates the principles for creating a system that effectively supports a collaborative partnership between a human expert and an AI. The answer will be the specific design of the Document-Based Process Model Explorer (DBPME), as visually prototyped in the mockup.

The explanation will detail how the tool's architecture and features, as shown in the mockup, are purpose-built to achieve a superior user experience. This includes:

- **A Multi-Panel Interface:** The design, featuring dedicated panels for documents, the main model canvas, and a model repository, provides a structured and organized workspace.
    
- **Bidirectional Visual Linking:** The core innovation, visually represented by the synchronized highlighting between the text in the left panel and the model elements in the center panel, is the primary mechanism for ensuring **usability**. This feature is designed to foster transparency and make the AI's output immediately verifiable.
    
- **Effective Functionality:** The mockup illustrates essential functions for a professional workflow, such as the ability to manage multiple documents and models, edit element properties, and handle complex structures like subprocesses ("Model_7"). These features provide the **functionality** needed for users to not just view, but actively refine and correct the generated model.
    
- **Positive User Experience:** By providing these features in an integrated environment, the design aims to reduce the high cognitive load typically associated with manual modeling. Instead of mentally mapping text to a model, the user can rely on the tool's visual guidance, leading to a more intuitive and less error-prone **user experience**.
    

**RQ3: To what extent does the Document-Based Process Model Explorer enhance the overall effectiveness of its target users when compared to traditional modeling workflows?**

**Explanation:** This question addresses the crucial need to prove that the proposed solution provides a tangible and measurable improvement over existing methods. It focuses on quantifying the "overall success" of the DBPME for its target users—requirements engineers and process designers. The "traditional workflow" serving as the baseline for comparison is a non-integrated, manual process where a user consults a text document and builds a model from scratch in a separate tool, without the aid of AI generation or interactive linking.

To provide a robust answer, the explanation details a formal user study designed to evaluate **overall effectiveness** across three distinct dimensions:

1. **Impact on Output Quality:** This measures the tool's ability to help users produce a better final product. The mockup shows a system designed for detailed refinement. We will evaluate this by measuring the **accuracy and completeness** of the process models that users produce with the tool. These user-corrected models will be compared against a pre-defined "gold standard" using objective metrics (e.g., precision, recall, structural similarity) to determine if the tool leads to a demonstrably higher quality outcome than a purely manual effort.
    
2. **Impact on Modeling Performance:** This measures how the tool improves the user's process of working. The core innovation shown in the mockup—the interactive linking—is designed to streamline the validation workflow. We will evaluate this by measuring **modeling performance** through metrics such as the user's error-detection rate and their perceived mental workload (assessed via validated questionnaires like the NASA-TLX). This will prove whether the tool makes the complex task of model creation and validation cognitively easier and more efficient.
    
3. **Impact on Professional Confidence:** This measures the tool's unique benefit in addressing the critical challenge of trust in AI. The "glass box" design, visually represented in the mockup by the synchronized highlighting, provides direct traceability. We will evaluate this by measuring the **professional confidence** of requirements engineers and process designers through post-task questionnaires. This will assess their trust in the final model's correctness and their confidence in their own ability to have successfully validated it—a key factor for the tool's adoption in a professional setting.
