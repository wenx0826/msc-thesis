### Gemini v1
This thesis is organized into the following chapters, which guide the reader from the foundational research through the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Document-Based Process Model Explorer.

*   **Chapter 2: Related Work**
    This chapter reviews the state-of-the-art in process modeling, text-to-model generation, and the challenges of Generative AI, establishing the research gap this thesis addresses.

*   **Chapter 3: Solution Design**
    This chapter presents the detailed design and architecture of the Document-Based Process Model Explorer (DBPME), translating the vision from the mockup into a formal specification for a human-in-the-loop system.

*   **Chapter 4: Implementation**
    This chapter documents the technical realization of the DBPME, describing the technologies used to build the functional online tool and implement its core interactive features as shown in the mockup.

*   **Chapter 5: Evaluation**
    This chapter details the execution and results of the formal user study, presenting the empirical evidence that measures the tool's effectiveness compared to traditional workflows.

*   **Chapter 6: Discussion**
    This chapter interprets the evaluation results in the context of the research questions, analyzes their implications for the fields of BPM and HCI, and discusses the limitations of the study.

*   **Chapter 7: Conclusion**
    This chapter summarizes the key findings and contributions of the thesis and suggests promising directions for future research.
