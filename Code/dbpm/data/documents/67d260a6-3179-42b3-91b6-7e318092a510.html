### Gemini v1
This project will be conducted using the **Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM)**, a well-established framework for research in Information Systems. DSR is perfectly suited for this project as its primary goal is the creation and evaluation of a novel IT artifact designed to solve a relevant, real-world problem—in this case, the problem of validating and refining business process models generated by opaque AI services.

**(1) Summary of Design Science Research**

Design Science Research is a problem-solving paradigm focused on creating innovative artifacts to address specific challenges. Unlike behavioral science, which seeks to *explain* or *predict* phenomena, design science aims to *create* useful things that serve human purposes. The process is inherently iterative, cycling through the activities of building an artifact and evaluating its performance in a given context.

The DSRM framework provides structure to this creative process. It involves a continuous interplay between the *problem environment* (where the real-world challenges exist), the *knowledge base* (containing existing theories and methods), and the core *design cycle* of building and evaluating the artifact. The outputs of DSR are not just the final system but also the knowledge gained in the process, which can be in the form of constructs (vocabulary), models (abstractions), methods (step-by-step approaches), or instantiations (the implemented system).

**(2) Application of DSRM to this Project**

The DSRM will be applied to this thesis as follows, with each component directly informed by the project's goals and the visual design of the mockup.

*   **Stakeholders:** The primary stakeholders are the individuals and groups involved in the process discovery lifecycle, whose work is often manual, time-consuming, and requires deep expertise. The DBPME is designed for:
    *   **Requirements Engineers & Process Designers:** As the target users, this tool aims to enhance their workflow by automating the initial model draft and providing powerful features for validation, directly addressing the challenges of manual model creation.
    *   **Domain Experts / Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):** These individuals possess deep process knowledge but may lack formal modeling skills. The intuitive, visual nature of the tool, as shown in the mockup, is designed to empower them to directly participate in the validation of AI-generated models.
    *   **Business Analysts & Managers:** These stakeholders rely on accurate process models for analysis, decision-making, and strategic alignment. The tool helps ensure the models they use are of higher quality and can be created more efficiently.

*   **Artifacts:** The research will produce several artifacts, with the primary one being the online tool itself:
    *   **Instantiation (The Primary Artifact):** The main artifact is the implemented **Document-Based Process Model Explorer (DBPME)**, a functional online tool that realizes the vision shown in the mockup. This instantiation includes the multi-panel user interface with its document management list (left panel), the central interactive model canvas, the model repository (right panel), and the properties editor.
    *   **Model:** The underlying system architecture that integrates a front-end user interface with a back-end that orchestrates calls to the generative AI API. This architecture is the abstract representation of the tool shown in the mockup.
    *   **Method:** The novel *human-in-the-loop workflow* enabled by the tool. This method, visually implied by the mockup's interactive features (e.g., text highlighting, model selection, regeneration), represents a new, step-by-step approach for validating and refining AI-generated process models.

*   **Steps:** The research will follow a structured DSRM process model, adapted for this project:
    1.  **Problem Identification and Motivation:** This step has been completed and is detailed in the Motivation section (1.1). The problem is the lack of trust, transparency, and verifiability in process models generated by "black-box" AI APIs.
    2.  **Define Objectives for a Solution:** The objectives are to create a tool that (a) seamlessly integrates with a generative AI service, (b) makes the AI's output transparent through the interactive visualization shown in the mockup, and (c) enables users to efficiently validate and correct the generated model.
    3.  **Design and Development:** This is the core construction phase where the DBPME artifact will be designed and implemented. This involves building the front-end application based on the mockup's design and developing the back-end logic to manage documents, interface with the AI API, and handle the data required for the visual linking.
    4.  **Demonstration:** The implemented tool will be used to solve an instance of the problem. This will involve demonstrating the complete workflow: uploading a document, triggering the AI generation, and then using the interactive features of the tool (as shown in the mockup) to explore, validate, and refine the resulting process model.
    5.  **Evaluation:** This crucial step, detailed in the next section (1.5), involves rigorously evaluating the artifact to answer the research questions. It will measure the tool's impact on its target users.
    6.  **Communication:** The results of the research—including the design of the artifact, the new workflow it enables, and its evaluated impact—will be communicated through the final master's thesis document.
## Prelexity v1

This research employs **Design Science Research in Information Systems (DSR)** as outlined by Hevner, March, Park, and Ram (2004) to systematically develop and evaluate the Document-Based Process Model Explorer (DBPME). Design Science Research is particularly well-suited for this project as it focuses on creating innovative artifacts that address practical problems while contributing to scientific knowledge (Hevner et al., 2004). The methodology enables the creation of technology-based solutions to important business problems through rigorous construction and evaluation of design artifacts (Hevner et al., 2004).

### 1.4.1 Design Science Research Framework

The DSR approach is structured around **Hevner's Three-Cycle Framework** (Hevner, 2007), which provides a comprehensive methodological foundation that ensures both practical relevance and scientific rigor:

**Relevance Cycle**: This cycle establishes the connection between the research and its practical application environment. It inputs requirements from the contextual environment of business process management and introduces the research artifacts back into real-world field testing (Hevner, 2007). For this project, the relevance cycle captures the specific challenges faced by requirements engineers and process designers when working with LLM-generated process models, particularly the lack of traceability and trust issues identified in contemporary BPM practice (Dumas et al., 2018).

**Rigor Cycle**: This cycle ensures scientific grounding by providing theories, methods, and domain expertise from the established knowledge base while contributing new knowledge back to the growing scientific foundation (Hevner, 2007). The rigor cycle draws upon existing research in business process modeling, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence, while contributing novel insights about human-AI collaboration in process modeling contexts (Dumas et al., 2018).

**Design Cycle**: This central cycle supports iterative construction and evaluation of design artifacts and processes (Hevner, 2007). It encompasses the core build-and-evaluate loop that refines the DBPME through multiple iterations based on feedback from both theoretical foundations and practical applications (Hevner et al., 2004).

### 1.4.2 Research Approach and Guidelines

The research follows **Hevner's Seven Guidelines for Design Science Research** (Hevner et al., 2004), which provide a structured framework for conducting rigorous design research:

**Guideline 1 - Design as an Artifact**: The primary output is the Document-Based Process Model Explorer, a functional web-based tool that integrates document management, interactive visualization, and bidirectional linking capabilities between textual sources and process model elements (Hevner et al., 2004).

**Guideline 2 - Problem Relevance**: The research addresses the critical challenge of traceability and trust in AI-generated business process models, directly responding to the limitations of current LLM-based approaches in BPM contexts (Hevner et al., 2004).

**Guideline 3 - Design Evaluation**: The artifact undergoes rigorous evaluation through multiple methods including controlled experiments comparing traditional workflows with the DBPME, usability testing with target users, and assessment of model quality improvements (Hevner et al., 2004).

**Guideline 4 - Research Contributions**: The research contributes both a novel technological artifact and new design knowledge about human-AI collaboration paradigms in process modeling, specifically the bidirectional visual linking approach for model validation (Hevner et al., 2004).

**Guideline 5 - Research Rigor**: The methodology employs established theories from HCI, BPM, and AI research while applying rigorous construction and evaluation methods throughout the development process (Hevner et al., 2004).

**Guideline 6 - Design as a Search Process**: The development follows an iterative approach, utilizing available knowledge and methods to reach desired functionality while satisfying technical and usability constraints (Hevner et al., 2004).

**Guideline 7 - Communication of Research**: Findings are communicated to both academic and practitioner communities, ensuring the research contributes to both theoretical understanding and practical application (Hevner et al., 2004).

### 1.4.3 Methodological Implementation

The research is conducted through the following integrated approach:

**Literature Review and Problem Space Analysis**: Comprehensive review of existing approaches, tools, and challenges in document-based business process modeling, with particular focus on the opportunities and limitations presented by generative AI technologies (Dumas et al., 2018; Ferreira et al., 2009).

**Artifact Design and Development**: Iterative design and implementation of the DBPME following user-centered design principles, incorporating stakeholder feedback and technical requirements identified through the relevance cycle (Ross, 2007).

**Evaluation Strategy**: Multi-method evaluation approach including comparative studies with traditional modeling workflows, usability assessments, and analysis of model quality outcomes to demonstrate the artifact's effectiveness (Mendling et al., 2018).

**Knowledge Contribution**: Systematic documentation and communication of design principles, implementation insights, and empirical findings that advance both the theoretical understanding of human-AI collaboration and practical approaches to process modeling tool design (Weske, 2019).

This methodological framework ensures that the research maintains the dual focus characteristic of Design Science Research: solving practical problems in business process modeling while contributing novel scientific knowledge about the design and evaluation of human-AI collaborative systems in information systems contexts (Hevner et al., 2004; Hevner, 2007).



## Grok v1

This thesis adopts Design Science Research (DSR) as its overarching methodological framework, guided by the principles outlined by Hevner et al. (2004). DSR is an established paradigm in information systems research that emphasizes the creation, evaluation, and refinement of innovative artifacts to address real-world organizational problems. Unlike purely behavioral science approaches, which focus on explaining phenomena, DSR treats design as a search process aimed at developing practical solutions that are both theoretically grounded and empirically validated. This methodology is particularly apt for the current study, as it centers on the development of an IT artifact—the Document-Based Process Model Explorer (DBPME)—to resolve the identified challenges of traceability, trust, and validation in AI-assisted business process modeling.

Hevner et al. (2004) propose seven guidelines for conducting rigorous DSR, which structure the research process in this thesis. These guidelines ensure that the work is relevant, rigorous, and contributory, while balancing the demands of problem-solving with scientific inquiry. The application of each guideline is described below, mapping directly to the research questions and activities.

**Guideline 1: Design as an Artifact.** DSR must produce a viable artifact in the form of a construct, model, method, or instantiation. In this thesis, the primary artifact is the DBPME, a web-based tool that integrates document viewing, process model generation via LLMs, and interactive features for bidirectional traceability. This instantiation addresses the practical need for a human-in-the-loop system in BPM, as prototyped in the mockup (Figure 1). The design and implementation of DBPME form the core of RQ2, where the tool's architecture is iteratively developed to support usability and functionality.

**Guideline 2: Problem Relevance.** The artifact must solve an important and relevant business problem. This thesis establishes relevance through RQ1, which examines the challenges in document-based process modeling, such as LLM hallucinations and lack of causal reasoning, within the context of Generative AI opportunities. By drawing from real-world BPM contexts—where inefficiencies in manual synthesis and trust deficits in automated tools hinder organizational performance—the research ensures the artifact targets pressing issues faced by requirements engineers and process designers.

**Guideline 3: Design Evaluation.** The utility, quality, and efficacy of the artifact must be rigorously demonstrated via well-executed evaluation methods. RQ3 directly fulfills this by comparing DBPME against traditional manual workflows through empirical measures, including model quality (e.g., accuracy and completeness), user performance (e.g., time efficiency), and professional confidence (e.g., subjective trust assessments). Evaluation will employ mixed methods, such as controlled experiments with target users, usability testing, and quantitative metrics like error rates in generated models, to provide robust evidence of improvement.

**Guideline 4: Research Contributions.** DSR must provide clear and verifiable contributions in the areas of the design artifact, foundations, and/or methodologies. As outlined in the Contribution section, this thesis delivers: (1) the implemented DBPME tool as a tangible artifact; (2) a novel interactive paradigm for model traceability via bidirectional visual linking; and (3) empirical insights into human-AI collaboration in BPM. These extend the knowledge base in BPM and HCI, offering reusable design principles for verifiable AI systems.

**Guideline 5: Research Rigor.** DSR relies on the application of rigorous methods in both the construction and evaluation of the artifact. Rigor is achieved through a systematic literature review in RQ1 to ground the work in existing theories (e.g., BPM fundamentals from Dumas et al., 2018, and LLM limitations from Ji et al., 2023). For construction (RQ2), established design principles from HCI—such as iterative prototyping and user-centered design—are applied, informed by frameworks like human-in-the-loop workflows (Weske, 2019). Evaluation (RQ3) incorporates statistical analysis and qualitative feedback to ensure validity and reliability.

**Guideline 6: Design as a Search Process.** The search for an effective artifact requires utilizing available means to reach desired ends while satisfying laws in the problem environment. This thesis embodies an iterative design cycle: initial requirements gathering from literature and stakeholder needs (RQ1), prototype development and refinement (RQ2), and multiple evaluation iterations to optimize the tool (RQ3). Constraints such as LLM opacity and user resistance to change are navigated through incremental improvements, transforming the "black box" into a "glass box" via synchronized highlighting.

**Guideline 7: Communication of Research.** DSR must be presented effectively to both technology-oriented and management-oriented audiences. Findings will be disseminated through this thesis, potential publications in BPM and IS journals, and demonstrations of the DBPME tool. Technical details (e.g., architecture and algorithms) will target IS researchers, while managerial implications (e.g., enhanced process efficiency) will appeal to BPM practitioners.

In terms of the overall research process, this thesis follows the three interconnected cycles of DSR proposed by Hevner (2007): the **relevance cycle**, which links the research to environmental needs (primarily RQ1); the **rigor cycle**, which ensures grounding in the knowledge base through literature and methods; and the **design cycle**, which iterates between building and evaluating the artifact (RQ2 and RQ3). Data collection will include secondary sources (e.g., academic literature) for RQ1, prototyping artifacts and user feedback for RQ2, and primary empirical data (e.g., from user studies) for RQ3. This structured approach ensures that the research not only advances theoretical understanding but also delivers a practical, impactful solution in the era of Generative AI.
