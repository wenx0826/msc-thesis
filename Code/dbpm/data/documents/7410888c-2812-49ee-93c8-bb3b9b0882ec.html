Document-Based Process Modeling – Core Process

1. Document Ingestion
- User uploads one or more documents (text, PDF, or Word).
- System stores documents and extracts textual content.

2. Document Selection
- User selects a document for analysis.
- System displays document content and previously identified text segments.

3. Process Extraction
- System analyzes selected document text.
- Relevant text fragments are identified and linked to process steps.
- User triggers model generation or regeneration.

4. Process Model Generation
- System creates a visual process model from extracted information.
- Process includes tasks, decisions, flows, and subprocesses.
- Each model element is linked to its source document text.

5. Model Refinement
- User reviews and edits the generated process model.
- User defines task types, conditions, and subprocess relationships.
- System maintains traceability between model elements and document fragments.

6. Subprocess Linking
- Subprocesses reference separate process models.
- User can navigate between parent and child models.
- Hierarchical model relationships are preserved.

7. Model Management
- Multiple models are stored and listed.
- User switches between models and views previews.
- Models can be updated or reused.

8. Output
- Finalized process models are exported.
- Traceability between documents and processes is retained.
