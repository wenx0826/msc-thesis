This technology can produce a draft model in seconds, a task that might take a human analyst hours or days.\n\nHowever, this automation introduces a new critical problem: the \"black box\" dilemma. The API delivers a complete process model, but ==the user has no insight into _how_ the textual description was interpreted to create the final diagram. This lack of transparency creates a significant trust gap. Is the model a faithful representation of the source text? Are there subtle misinterpretations or logical errors hidden within the diagram? Without a clear and intuitive way to trace the connections between the source document and the generated model, the tasks of validation and correction remain difficult and time-consuming.=="
