Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Motivation\n\nA significant portion of any organization's operational knowledge is not stored in structured databases but is instead embedded within a vast and growing collection of unstructured documents.1 Manuals for standard operating procedures (SOPs), internal policy documents, project reports, and interview transcripts all contain detailed, context-rich descriptions of how work is actually performed. This \"latent\" process knowledge is a valuable asset, yet it remains largely inaccessible to the powerful automated analysis and optimization techniques that define modern Business Process Management (BPM).3 The task of manually extracting this knowledge and translating it into formal process models is the primary bottleneck in the BPM lifecycle.\n\nThis manual modeling is an exceptionally demanding endeavor. It is time-consuming, requires significant financial investment, and is highly susceptible to the subjective interpretations of the analyst performing the task."
