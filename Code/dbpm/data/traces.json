It seeks to measure the tangible value added by the interactive features. This will be answered through a formal user study where the quality of a model, after being corrected by a user with the tool, is quantitatively measured against a \"gold standard.\" The goal is to demonstrate that the system enables users to significantly improve upon the raw output of the API.\n    \n- **RQ3: What specific interactive features and visual cues are most effective in facilitating the cognitive process of aligning textual descriptions with their corresponding API-generated CPEE model elements?** This question delves deeper into the usability and HCI aspects of the system. It aims to identify which design choices contribute most to the system's success. This will be investigated through qualitative analysis of user study data, including think-aloud protocols and interviews, to understand which features users found most helpful for identifying and fixing errors.\n    \n\n### 1.3 Contribution\n\nThis research will make three primary contributions to the fields of Business Pro"
