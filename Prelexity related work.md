## Related Work

Research on workflow modeling effectiveness is well-established, spanning process engineering, workflow automation, and human-computer interaction perspectives. Below are the main strands of related work relevant for a thesis on this topic:

## 1. Process Modeling Foundations

Early work examined systematic approaches for representing and optimizing business processes, with foundational frameworks such as BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) and Petri nets establishing criteria for model clarity and correctness. These works underline the importance of mapping real-world activities into formal models for consistency, traceability, and optimization.

## 2. Quality Metrics and Guidelines

Scholars have proposed numerous metrics to assess workflow and process model quality. Cardoso’s and McCabe’s complexity metrics gauge the logical and structural difficulty of models, while empirical guidelines like the Seven Process Modeling Guidelines (7PMG) highlight the role of simplicity, minimize unnecessary connector use, and maximize understandability. Moody’s quality criteria further systematize model evaluation by focusing on graphical clarity and discrimination between modeling constructs.

## 3. Process Mining and Automation

Recent advancements in process mining (e.g., ProM, Celonis) facilitate automated discovery and assessment of process models from event logs or workflow execution traces. These tools apply machine learning and statistical measures—such as precision, recall, and F1 score—to quantify the correspondence between intended and actual process execution, indicating both the effectiveness of workflow modeling and areas for improvement.

## 4. Cycle and Performance Analysis

Operational metrics—such as cycle time, throughput, error rate, and process cycle efficiency—are frequently used in both academic research and industrial practice to measure workflow performance. Case studies often demonstrate how systematic workflow modeling reduces lead times, eliminates bottlenecks, and improves overall process quality, underscoring the significance of these measurements in evaluating modeling outcomes.

## 5. Usability and Organizational Impact

Several studies evaluate the usability and broader organizational impact of workflow modeling tools. User satisfaction, resource utilization, and error reduction are increasingly considered alongside technical performance, reflecting a broader trend to include human and organizational factors in effectiveness assessments.

## 6. Integrated Modeling Environments

Modern platforms such as Lucidchart, Bizagi Modeler, and Confluence demonstrate practical integration of process documentation and workflow modeling. These tools support versioning, collaboration, permissions, and visual diagramming, which facilitate the application and evaluation of workflow models within organizations.

## 7. Knowledge Management and Multi-Artifact Modeling

Emerging research explores how workflow modeling relates to organizational knowledge management and accommodates multiple types of artifacts (documents, data, subprocesses). These approaches address the complexity and heterogeneity of real-world processes, supporting more robust and adaptable workflow evaluations.

Collectively, these bodies of related work provide a strong foundation for designing thesis research on workflow modeling effectiveness. The present focus converges on combining rigorous metric-based evaluation, process mining automation, and human-centered usability analysis to provide comprehensive and actionable insights into workflow modeling outcomes.
