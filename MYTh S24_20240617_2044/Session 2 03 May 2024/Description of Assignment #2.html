<h4><strong>Prepare Your Preliminary Proposal!</strong></h4><br>Start by framing your thesis proposal with a compelling introduction to the research you are contemplating for your thesis. If you have not yet decided on a topic for your thesis, please choose a topic that might be a potential candidate for you to write on.
Your answers to the below questions  may help you develop a more accurate picture of the work you intend to execute. <br><br>Later, you may incorporate the answers to these inquiries into your final thesis proposal. When preparing the final thesis proposal, please consider the <a href="https://www.moodle.tum.de/mod/resource/view.php?id=2983554" target="_blank">template</a> I have shown in our session and the <a href="https://www.moodle.tum.de/mod/resource/view.php?id=2983555">Assessment Sheet</a> that could be looked upon as a list of requirements.
<br><br>As a final Master´s Thesis Proposal should be at most six pages long, keep your answers in this preliminary proposal short to fit<strong> <span class="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 207, 53);">three to four</span></strong><span class="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 207, 53);"> </span><span class="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 207, 53);">pages</span> <span class="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 207, 53);">(additional to the title page)</span>. Use 1.5 line spacing for better readability and follow the file naming pattern <span style="color: rgb(196, 7, 27);">YourName_Pre-proposal_S24</span>.<br><br>These are the questions to lead you:<br><br>1. What problem are you addressing?<br>2. What is the contribution to your field of research/inquiry?<br>3. Why is this problem important? (Why would this work be meaningful to someone not committed to your field?)<br>4. How are you going to attack the problem? (How will you subdivide the main task into manageable chunks?)<br>5. What resources will you need to reach your goal?<br><br>NB: <br>You are not required to hand in your outline again or write it anew. However, please <span class="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 207, 53);">include your </span><strong><span class="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 207, 53);">preliminary schedule</span></strong> in your pre-proposal.<br>Although it may be reasonable to prepare this preliminary proposal on the same topic your outline was about, you are not obliged to do so.<br>
