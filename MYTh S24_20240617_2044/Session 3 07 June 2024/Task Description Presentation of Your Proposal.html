<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">In our last session, you are requested to present your Master´s Thesis proposal that counts as the immanent examination. For that, each participant will get a time slot of 5 – 10 minutes, that will be followed by a Q&amp;A session of 3 – 5 minutes for everyone. We shall start our session as usual at 1:00pm and use about 20 minutes for organizing the sequence of presentations into groups.</p><div style="margin-left: 30px;" class="editor-indent"><div style="margin-left: 30px;" class="editor-indent"><ul><li>Slot for Group 1: <strong>1:20pm – 2:30pm</strong>. <br></li><li>Slot for Group 2: <strong>2:45pm – 4:00pm.</strong></li><li>Slot for Group 3: <strong>4:15pm – 4:30pm. </strong><em><span>(if more than ten participants wish to present) </span><strong><br></strong></em></li></ul></div></div><p>After all presentations, we will use some time for feedback and debriefing.</p><p>(1) In your presentation, you may&nbsp; focus on the leading questions of your pre-proposal, the answers to which you have already (mostly) elaborated in the introduction to the submitted written proposal. Your schedule for research and thesis writing might support the presentation by facts from realistic planning. Those questions were: <br></p><div style="margin-left: 30px;" class="editor-indent"><div style="margin-left: 30px;" class="editor-indent"><p></p><ol><li>What problem are you addressing?</li><li>What is the contribution to your field of research/inquiry?</li><li>Why is this problem important (why would this work be meaningful to someone not
committed to your field?)</li><li>How are you going to attack the problem? (how will you subdivide the main task
into manageable chunks?)</li><li>What resources will you need to reach your goal?</li></ol><p></p></div></div><p>(2) In case your Master´s Thesis project is already in an advanced stage, it may be more practicable for you to compile a draft presentation you might use for the defence session and benefit from the opportunity to rehearse it with us. Then, you should go into more datail on the validation of your initial idea, highlight your results and the added value and possible application of the outcomes. In this respect, the presentation would resemble the conclusions rather than the introduction. <br></p>
