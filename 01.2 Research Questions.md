**Process-Document Integration**
How can document content be effectively and automatically linked to process model elements to ensure traceability between business requirements and process design?
What are the best practices for visualizing and navigating the relationships between documents and process models in collaborative environments?

**Automation & Process Mining**
To what extent can process mining techniques be applied to unstructured or semi-structured documents for automated process model discovery?

How accurately can a document-based explorer detect deviations between prescribed processes and processes inferred from real document traces?

RQ2. **Tool Usability & User Experience**
What interaction paradigms increase user efficiency and accuracy when working with document-driven process modeling tools?

How do different user groups (e.g., business analysts vs. engineers) utilize document-based explorers compared to traditional process modeling tools?

**Collaboration & Knowledge Management**
In what ways does integrated document-process modeling impact knowledge sharing and process improvement within organizations?

How can conflicts or inconsistencies between overlapping documents and process models be detected and resolved automatically?

**Object & Multi-Artifact Modeling**
How should the explorer support modeling and analysis for processes involving multiple types of artifacts (documents, data, subprocesses, etc.) with complex interdependencies?

RQ3. **Evaluation & Impact**
What metrics can be used to measure the effectiveness of a document-based process model explorer versus conventional modeling tools?

How does the use of such tools affect compliance, change management, and process optimization in real-world case studies?
